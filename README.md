# Machine Learning

**ann**(python 3.6 | numpy1.15)implement a 3 layers neural netowrk, but no use L2 regularization in ann model.

**ocr_cnn_tensorflow**(python 3.6 | tensorflow 1.10)implement a 4 length verification code recognition model, model accuracy rate is over 97%。

**ocr_lstmctc_tensorflow**(python 3.6 | tensorflow 1.10)The model of variable length verification code recognition, 40000 pictures are iterated 50 times, and the accuracy rate is over 95%.

**recommendSys**(python 3.6 | tensorflow 1.10) The simple recommendation system is user-based, item-based, and LFM model, based on implicit feedback data (the explicit feedback data is also applicable to these models). The LFM model description links are as follows: http://www.jianshu.com/p/9270edf4b08b 。

**autoencoder**(python 2.7.13 | tensorflow 1.2)This model is often used to extract nonlinear effective features and reduce feature dimensions. The selection of activation functions is very important. It is necessary to find the most suitable parameters on different feature sets.

**Linear Discriminant Analysis**(python3.6 | numpy1.14)The linear discriminant analysis, the core is realized by eigenvalue decomposition, and there are three kinds of kernels in sklearn. It belongs to the feature dimension of supervised learning, while PCA is unsupervised learning. The theoretical knowledge and formula are based on Zhou Zhihua's machine learning books.

**Principal components analysis**(python3.6 | numpy1.14)Principal component analysis, the core is realized by eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition.

**abnormal_url_detection**(python3.6 | tensorflow 1.10 | gensim)Abnormal url detection, use lstm and dense layer.
